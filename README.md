# Weather Shrimp
A simple weather app for the command line on linux. Currently written in python to design simple layouts and other aspects

Final version will be written on C for debian systems, with the idea to move to other linux and windows systems.

The app currently only has one mode that gives your current location based on the BBC weather website and tells you the current temprature at that location finally a shrimp graphic will pop up and give a small report on the current weather.

More features such as seeing specific location and teprture at specific times will be added once the base version has been re written in C
