# CMD_Weather

This is a simple weather tool. You run the command it checks a weather websites and returns the current temprature and conditions

Currently it is default set to read the current weather at the default location of the user since that is how the website works. The tool does also return your current location

I am working on adding a nicer display (will still be commandline based)
